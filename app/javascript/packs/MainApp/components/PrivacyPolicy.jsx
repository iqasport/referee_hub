    <p>
      We are convinced that the protection of your data protection is important. The use of the
      International Quidditch Association’s Referee Hub is possible without any indication of
      personal data; however, if you like to register as a referee, processing of personal data
      is necessary. If the processing of personal data is necessary and there is no statutory
      basis for such processing, we generally obtain your consent. Thus we need to provide this
      privacy policy for inhabitants of the European Union to ask you for your consent. If you
      live in the European Union, this privacy policy is applicable to you and informs you about
      personal data we collect and process and about your rights concerning your data.
    </p>
    <p>
      The processing of personal data, such as the name, e-mail address, or gender of a data
      subject is in line with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). By means of this
      data protection declaration, we would like to inform the general public of the nature,
      scope, and purpose of the personal data we collect, use and process. Furthermore, data
      subjects are informed, by means of this data protection declaration, of the rights to
      which they are entitled.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the controller, the International Quidditch Association has implemented numerous
      technical and organizational measures to ensure the most complete protection of personal
      data processed through this website. However, Internet-based data transmissions may in
      principle have security gaps, so absolute protection may not be guaranteed.

      Cookies

    <p>
      The Referee Hub uses cookies. Cookies are text files that are stored in a computer system
      via an Internet browser. Many Internet sites and servers use cookies. Many cookies contain
      a so-called cookie ID. A cookie ID is a unique identifier of the cookie. It consists of a
      character string through which Internet pages and servers can be assigned to the specific
      Internet browser in which the cookie was stored. This allows visited Internet sites and
      servers to differentiate your individual browser from other Internet browsers that contain
      other cookies. A specific Internet browser can be recognized and identified using the unique
      cookie ID.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through the use of cookies, we can provide you the possibility to log in and recognize you
      as the logged in referee. You may, at any time, prevent the setting of cookies through our
      website by means of a corresponding setting of the Internet browser used, and may thus
      permanently deny the setting of cookies. Furthermore, already set cookies may be deleted
      at any time via an Internet browser or other software programs. This is possible in all
      popular Internet browsers. If you deactivate the setting of cookies in the Internet
      browser used, the login function is unusable.

      Collection of general data and information
    </Header>
    <p>
      The Referee Hub collects a series of general data and information when a data subject or
      automated system calls up the website. This general data and information are stored in the
      server log files. Collected may be (1) the browser types and versions used, (2) the
      operating system used by the accessing system, (3) the website from which an accessing
      system reaches our website (so-called referrers), (4) the sub-websites, (5) the date and
      time of access to the Internet site, (6) an Internet protocol address (IP address), (7)
      the Internet service provider of the accessing system, and (8) any other similar data and
      information that may be used in the event of attacks on our information technology
      systems.
    </p>
    <p>
      When using these general data and information, the International Quidditch Association
      does not draw any conclusions about you. Rather, this information is needed to (1) deliver
      the content of our website correctly, (2) optimize the content of our website, (3) ensure
      the long-term viability of our information technology systems and website technology, and
      (4) provide law enforcement authorities with the information necessary for criminal
      prosecution in case of a cyber-attack. Therefore, the International Quidditch Association
      analyzes anonymously collected data and information statistically, with the aim of
      increasing the data protection and data security of our enterprise, and to ensure an
      optimal level of protection for the personal data we process. The anonymous data of the
      server log files are stored separately from all personal data provided by a data subject.

      Registration
    </Header>
    <p>
      You have the possibility to register on the website of the controller with the indication
      of personal data. For this reason you may enter your email address. The entered email
      address is publicly visible on your referee profile. You are free to ask us to change your
      email address or to delete your referee profile including your email address.
    </p>
    <p>
      We will provide information upon request to you as to what personal data are stored about
      you. In addition, we will correct or erase personal data at your request or indication,
      insofar as there are no statutory storage obligations.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the registration with your email address, you are free to add additional personal
      data to your referee profile, which are not required to use Referee Hub (but may be
      required to prove your identity to tournament organizers). These include your name, your
      pronouns, your National Governing Body affiliations and additional information about
      yourself. Every information entered is visible to anyone on your public referee profile
      and you can change and remove it at any time. You also have the choice to not show your
      pronouns on your public referee profile.

      Your Rights
    </Header>
    <p>
      You have the right granted by the European legislator to obtain our confirmation as to
      whether or not personal data concerning you are being processed, to ask us which data we
      store about you, to rectify inaccurate personal data, to complete data, to ask us to erase
      your data, to get your data in machine-readable format for portability, to object to the
      processing of your personal data and to withdraw your consent. If you wish to avail
      yourself of this rights, you may, at any time, contact the IQA.

      Payment Method: Data protection provisions about the use of PayPal as a payment
      processor
    </Header>
    <p>
      On this website, we have integrated components of PayPal. PayPal is an online
      payment service provider. Payments are processed via so-called PayPal accounts, which
      represent virtual private or business accounts. PayPal is also able to process virtual
      payments through credit cards when a user does not have a PayPal account. A PayPal account
      is managed via an e-mail address, which is why there are no classic account numbers.
      PayPal makes it possible to trigger online payments to third parties or to receive
      payments. PayPal also accepts trustee functions and offers buyer protection services.
    </p>
    <p>
      The European operating company of PayPal is PayPal (Europe) S.à.r.l. & Cie. S.C.A., 22-24
      Boulevard Royal, 2449 Luxembourg, Luxembourg.
    </p>
    <p>
      For you to be able to pay with paypal, we automatically transmit data about you to PayPal.
      You agree to the transfer of personal data required for payment processing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The transmission of the data is aimed at payment processing and fraud prevention. The
      controller will transfer personal data to PayPal, in particular, if a legitimate interest
      in the transmission is given. The personal data exchanged between PayPal and the
      controller for the processing of the data will be transmitted by PayPal to economic credit
      agencies. This transmission is intended for identity and creditworthiness checks.
    </p>
    <p>
      PayPal will, if necessary, pass on personal data to affiliates and service providers or
      subcontractors to the extent that this is necessary to fulfill contractual obligations or
      for data to be processed in the order.
    </p>
    <p>
      The applicable data protection provisions of PayPal may be retrieved under
      https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/ua/privacy-full.

      Legal basis for the processing
    </Header>
    <p>
      Art. 6(1) lit. a GDPR serves as the legal basis for processing operations for which we
      obtain consent for a specific processing purpose. If the processing of personal data is
      necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party, as is the
      case, for example, when processing operations are necessary for the supply of goods or to
      provide any other service, the processing is based on Article 6(1) lit. b GDPR. The same
      applies to such processing operations which are necessary for carrying out pre-contractual
      measures, for example in the case of inquiries concerning our products or services. Is our
      company subject to a legal obligation by which processing of personal data is required,
      such as for the fulfillment of tax obligations, the processing is based on Art. 6(1) lit.
      c GDPR. In rare cases, the processing of personal data may be necessary to protect the
      vital interests of the data subject or of another natural person. Then the processing would be
      based on Art. 6(1) lit. d GDPR. Finally, processing operations could be based on Article 6(1)
      lit. f GDPR. This legal basis is used for processing operations which are not covered by any
      of the abovementioned legal grounds, if processing is necessary for the purposes of the
      legitimate interests pursued by our company or by a third party, except where such interests
      are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which
      require protection of personal data. Such processing operations are particularly permissible
      because they have been specifically mentioned by the European legislator. He considered that a
      legitimate interest could be assumed if the data subject is a client of the controller
      (Recital 47 Sentence 2 GDPR).
