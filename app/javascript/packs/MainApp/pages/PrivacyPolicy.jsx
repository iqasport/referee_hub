    <p>
      We understand that the protection of your data is important. The use of the International Quidditch Association’s
      Referee Hub is possible without any indication of personal data; however, if you would like to register as a
      referee, processing of personal data is necessary. If the processing of personal data is necessary and there is no
      statutory basis for such processing, we generally obtain your consent. Thus we need to provide this privacy policy
      for inhabitants of the European Union to ask you for your consent. If you live in the European Union, this privacy
      policy is applicable to you and informs you about the personal data we collect and process, and about your rights
      concerning your data.
    </p>
    <p>
      The processing of personal data, such as the name, email address, or gender of a data subject is in line with the
      General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). By means of this data protection declaration, we would like to inform
      the general public of the nature, scope, and purpose of the personal data we collect, use and process.
      Furthermore, data subjects are informed, by means of this data protection declaration, of the rights to which they
      are entitled.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the controller, the International Quidditch Association has implemented numerous technical and organizational
      measures to ensure the most complete protection of personal data processed through this website. However,
      Internet-based data transmissions may in principle have security gaps, so absolute protection may not be
      guaranteed.

      Cookies

    <p>
      The Referee Hub uses cookies. Cookies are text files that are stored in a computer system via an Internet browser.
      Many Internet sites and servers use cookies. Many cookies contain a so-called cookie ID. A cookie ID is a unique
      identifier of the cookie. It consists of a character string through which Internet pages and servers can be
      assigned to the specific Internet browser in which the cookie was stored. This allows visited Internet sites and
      servers to differentiate your individual browser from other Internet browsers that contain other cookies. A
      specific Internet browser can be recognized and identified using the unique cookie ID.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through the use of cookies, we can provide you the possibility to log in and recognize you as the logged in
      referee. You may, at any time, prevent the setting of cookies through our website by means of a corresponding
      setting of the Internet browser used, and may thus permanently deny the setting of cookies. Furthermore, already
      set cookies may be deleted at any time via an Internet browser or other software programs. This is possible in all
      popular Internet browsers. If you deactivate the setting of cookies in the Internet browser used, the login
      function is unusable.

      Collection of general data and information
    </Header>
    <p>
      The Referee Hub collects a series of general data and information when a data subject or automated system calls up
      the website. This general data and information are stored in the server log files. Collected may be (1) the
      browser types and versions used, (2) the operating system used by the accessing system, (3) the website from which
      an accessing system reaches our website (so-called referrers), (4) the sub-websites, (5) the date and time of
      access to the Internet site, (6) an Internet protocol address (IP address), (7) the Internet service provider of
      the accessing system, and (8) any other similar data and information that may be used in the event of attacks on
      our information technology systems.
    </p>
    <p>
      When using these general data and information, the International Quidditch Association does not draw any
      conclusions about you. Rather, this information is needed to (1) deliver the content of our website correctly, (2)
      optimize the content of our website, (3) ensure the long-term viability of our information technology systems and
      website technology, and (4) provide law enforcement authorities with the information necessary for criminal
      prosecution in case of a cyber-attack. Therefore, the International Quidditch Association analyzes anonymously
      collected data and information statistically, with the aim of increasing the data protection and data security of
      our enterprise, and to ensure an optimal level of protection for the personal data we process. The anonymous data
      of the server log files are stored separately from all personal data provided by a data subject.

      Registration
    </Header>
    <p>
      You have the possibility to register on the website of the controller with the indication of personal data. For
      this reason you may enter your email address. The entered email address is publicly visible on your referee
      profile. You are free to ask us to change your email address or to delete your referee profile including your
      email address.
    </p>
    <p>
      We will provide information upon request to you as to what personal data are stored about you. In addition, we
      will correct or erase personal data at your request or indication, insofar as there are no statutory storage
      obligations.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the registration with your email address, you are free to add additional personal data to your referee
      profile, which are not required to use Referee Hub (but may be required to prove your identity to tournament
      organizers). These include your name, your pronouns, your National Governing Body affiliations and additional
      information about yourself. All information entered is visible to anyone on your public referee profile and you
      can change and remove it at any time. You also have the choice to not show your pronouns on your public referee
      profile.

      Your Rights
    </Header>
    <p>
      You have the right granted by the European legislator to obtain our confirmation as to whether or not personal
      data concerning you are being processed, to ask us which data we store about you, to rectify inaccurate personal
      data, to complete data, to ask us to erase your data, to get your data in machine-readable format for portability,
      to object to the processing of your personal data and to withdraw your consent. If you wish to avail yourself of
      this rights, you may, at any time, contact the IQA.

      Payment Method: Data protection provisions about the use of PayPal as a payment processor
    </Header>
    <p>
      On this website, we have integrated components of PayPal. PayPal is an online payment service provider. Payments
      are processed via so-called PayPal accounts, which represent virtual private or business accounts. PayPal is also
      able to process virtual payments through credit cards when a user does not have a PayPal account. A PayPal account
      is managed via an email address, which is why there are no classic account numbers. PayPal makes it possible to
      trigger online payments to third parties or to receive payments. PayPal also accepts trustee functions and offers
      buyer protection services.
    </p>
    <p>
      The European operating company of PayPal is PayPal (Europe) S.à.r.l. & Cie. S.C.A., 22-24 Boulevard Royal, 2449
      Luxembourg, Luxembourg.
    </p>
    <p>
      For you to be able to pay with PayPal, we automatically transmit data about you to PayPal. You agree to the
      transfer of personal data required for payment processing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The transmission of the data is aimed at payment processing and fraud prevention. The controller will transfer
      personal data to PayPal, in particular, if a legitimate interest in the transmission is given. The personal data
      exchanged between PayPal and the controller for the processing of the data will be transmitted by PayPal to
      economic credit agencies. This transmission is intended for identity and creditworthiness checks.
    </p>
    <p>
      PayPal will, if necessary, pass on personal data to affiliates and service providers or subcontractors to the
      extent that this is necessary to fulfill contractual obligations or for data to be processed in the order.
    </p>
    <p>
      The applicable data protection provisions of PayPal may be retrieved under
      https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/ua/privacy-full.

      Legal basis for the processing
    </Header>
    <p>
      Art. 6(1) lit. a GDPR serves as the legal basis for processing operations for which we obtain consent for a
      specific processing purpose. If the processing of personal data is necessary for the performance of a contract to
      which the data subject is party, as is the case, for example, when processing operations are necessary for the
      supply of goods or to provide any other service, the processing is based on Article 6(1) lit. b GDPR. The same
      applies to such processing operations which are necessary for carrying out pre-contractual measures, for example
      in the case of inquiries concerning our products or services. If we are subject to a legal obligation by which
      processing of personal data is required, the processing is based on Art. 6(1) lit. c GDPR. In rare cases, the
      processing of personal data may be necessary to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another
      natural person. Then the processing would be based on Art. 6(1) lit. d GDPR. Finally, processing operations could
      be based on Article 6(1) lit. f GDPR. This legal basis is used for processing operations which are not covered by
      any of the abovementioned legal grounds, if processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests
      pursued by our company or by a third party, except where such interests are overridden by the interests or
      fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require protection of personal data. Such processing
      operations are particularly permissible because they have been specifically mentioned by the European legislator.
      He considered that a legitimate interest could be assumed if the data subject is a client of the controller
      (Recital 47 Sentence 2 GDPR).
