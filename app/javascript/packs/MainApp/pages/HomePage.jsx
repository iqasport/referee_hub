        <p>
          The home for all international quidditch referees. Here you will find every referee qualified by the IQA based on their certifications, their National Governing Body affiliation, and their name.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a referee you're able to register and youâ€™ll be able to immediately take written tests to become certified as snitch referee and/or assistant referee. If you passed both tests, you're free to pay for the written head referee test. Soon you'll also be able to find resources to cultivate your skills as a quidditch referee.
