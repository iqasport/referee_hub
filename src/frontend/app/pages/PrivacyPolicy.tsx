    <p className="my-4">
      We understand that the protection of your data is important. The use of the International
      Quidditch Associationâ€™s Management Hub is possible without any indication of personal data;
      however, if you would like to register as a user, processing of personal data is necessary. If
      the processing of personal data is necessary and there is no statutory basis for such
      processing, we generally obtain your consent. Thus we need to provide this privacy policy for
      inhabitants of the European Union to ask you for your consent. If you live in the European
      Union, this privacy policy is applicable to you and informs you about the personal data we
      collect and process, and about your rights concerning your data.
    </p>
    <p className="my-4">
      The processing of personal data, such as the name, email address, or gender of a data subject
      is in line with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). By means of this data
      protection declaration, we would like to inform the general public of the nature, scope, and
      purpose of the personal data we collect, use and process. Furthermore, data subjects are
      informed, by means of this data protection declaration, of the rights to which they are
      entitled.

    <p className="my-4">
      As the controller, the International Quidditch Association has implemented numerous technical
      and organizational measures to ensure the most complete protection of personal data processed
      through this website. However, Internet-based data transmissions may in principle have
      security gaps, so absolute protection may not be guaranteed.

    <p className="my-4">
      The Management Hub uses cookies. Cookies are text files that are stored in a computer system
      via an Internet browser. Many Internet sites and servers use cookies. Many cookies contain a
      so-called cookie ID. A cookie ID is a unique identifier of the cookie. It consists of a
      character string through which Internet pages and servers can be assigned to the specific
      Internet browser in which the cookie was stored. This allows visited Internet sites and
      servers to differentiate your individual browser from other Internet browsers that contain
      other cookies. A specific Internet browser can be recognized and identified using the unique
      cookie ID.
    </p>
    <p className="my-4">
      Through the use of cookies, we can provide you the possibility to log in and recognize you as
      the logged in user. You may, at any time, prevent the setting of cookies through our website
      by means of a corresponding setting of the Internet browser used, and may thus permanently
      deny the setting of cookies. Furthermore, already set cookies may be deleted at any time via
      an Internet browser or other software programs. This is possible in all popular Internet
      browsers. If you deactivate the setting of cookies in the Internet browser used, the login
      function is unusable.

    <h2 className="text-2xl">Collection of general data and information</h2>
    <p className="my-4">
      The Management Hub collects a series of general data and information when a data subject or
      automated system calls up the website. This general data and information are stored in the
      server log files. Collected may be (1) the browser types and versions used, (2) the operating
      system used by the accessing system, (3) the website from which an accessing system reaches
      our website (so-called referrers), (4) the sub-websites, (5) the date and time of access to
      the Internet site, (6) an Internet protocol address (IP address), (7) the Internet service
      provider of the accessing system, and (8) any other similar data and information that may be
      used in the event of attacks on our information technology systems.
    </p>
    <p className="my-4">
      When using these general data and information, the International Quidditch Association does
      not draw any conclusions about you. Rather, this information is needed to (1) deliver the
      content of our website correctly, (2) optimize the content of our website, (3) ensure the
      long-term viability of our information technology systems and website technology, and (4)
      provide law enforcement authorities with the information necessary for criminal prosecution in
      case of a cyber-attack. Therefore, the International Quidditch Association analyzes
      anonymously collected data and information statistically, with the aim of increasing the data
      protection and data security of our enterprise, and to ensure an optimal level of protection
      for the personal data we process. The anonymous data of the server log files are stored
      separately from all personal data provided by a data subject.
    </p>
    <h2 className="text-2xl">Registration</h2>
    <p className="my-4">
      You have the possibility to register on the website of the controller with the indication of
      personal data. For this reason you may enter your email address. The entered email address is
      not publicly visible on your user profile. You are free to ask us to change your email address
      or to delete your user profile including your email address.
    </p>
    <p className="my-4">
      We will provide information upon request to you as to what personal data are stored about you.
      In addition, we will correct or erase personal data at your request or indication, insofar as
      there are no statutory storage obligations.
    </p>
    <p className="my-4">
      After the registration with your email address, you are free to add additional personal data
      to your user profile, which are not required to use Management Hub (but may be required to
      prove your identity to tournament organizers). These include your name, your pronouns, your
      National Governing Body affiliations and additional information about yourself. All
      information entered is visible to anyone on your public user profile and you can change and
      remove it at any time. You also have the choice to not show your pronouns on your public user
      profile.
    </p>
    <h2 className="text-2xl">Your Rights</h2>
    <p className="my-4">
      You have the right granted by the European legislator to obtain our confirmation as to whether
      or not personal data concerning you are being processed, to ask us which data we store about
      you, to rectify inaccurate personal data, to complete data, to ask us to erase your data, to
      get your data in machine-readable format for portability, to object to the processing of your
      personal data and to withdraw your consent. If you wish to avail yourself of this rights, you
      may, at any time, contact the IQA.

      Payment Method: Data protection provisions about the use of Stripe as a payment processor
    </h2>
    <p className="my-4">
      On this website, we have integrated components of Stripe. Stripe is an online payment service
      provider. Payments are processed via so-called Stripe accounts, which represent virtual
      private or business accounts. Stripe is also able to process virtual payments through credit
      cards when a user does not have a Stripe account. A Stripe account is managed via an email
      address, which is why there are no classic account numbers. Stripe makes it possible to
      trigger online payments to third parties or to receive payments. Stripe also accepts trustee
      functions and offers buyer protection services.
    </p>
    <p className="my-4">
      For you to be able to pay with Stripe, we automatically transmit data about you to Stripe. You
      agree to the transfer of personal data required for payment processing.
    </p>
    <p className="my-4">
      The transmission of the data is aimed at payment processing and fraud prevention. The
      controller will transfer personal data to Stripe, in particular, if a legitimate interest in
      the transmission is given. The personal data exchanged between Stripe and the controller for
      the processing of the data will be transmitted by Stripe to economic credit agencies. This
      transmission is intended for identity and creditworthiness checks.
    </p>
    <p className="my-4">
      Stripe will, if necessary, pass on personal data to affiliates and service providers or
      subcontractors to the extent that this is necessary to fulfill contractual obligations or for
      data to be processed in the order.
    </p>
    <p className="my-4">
      The applicable data protection provisions of Stripe may be retrieved under
      https://stripe.com/privacy.
    </p>
    <h2 className="text-2xl">Legal basis for the processing</h2>
    <p className="my-4">
      Art. 6(1) lit. a GDPR serves as the legal basis for processing operations for which we obtain
      consent for a specific processing purpose. If the processing of personal data is necessary for
      the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party, as is the case, for example,
      when processing operations are necessary for the supply of goods or to provide any other
      service, the processing is based on Article 6(1) lit. b GDPR. The same applies to such
      processing operations which are necessary for carrying out pre-contractual measures, for
      example in the case of inquiries concerning our products or services. If we are subject to a
      legal obligation by which processing of personal data is required, the processing is based on
      Art. 6(1) lit. c GDPR. In rare cases, the processing of personal data may be necessary to
      protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another natural person. Then the
      processing would be based on Art. 6(1) lit. d GDPR. Finally, processing operations could be
      based on Article 6(1) lit. f GDPR. This legal basis is used for processing operations which
      are not covered by any of the abovementioned legal grounds, if processing is necessary for the
      purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by our company or by a third party, except where
      such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data
      subject which require protection of personal data. Such processing operations are particularly
      permissible because they have been specifically mentioned by the European legislator. He
      considered that a legitimate interest could be assumed if the data subject is a client of the
      controller (Recital 47 Sentence 2 GDPR).
